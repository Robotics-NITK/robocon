# Cache
https://nitk.acm.org/cache.html

Cache was created by ACM NITK so that freshers coming to NITK can get to know their way around campus. It is a webpage that uses Google Maps API consisting of different landmarks in college with routes to get from one landmark to another.
## Functionality
All input boxes accept tags as inputs which can be found under the section "Search for Tags".
1) Search - This takes in tags as input and points to that particular tag in the Maps section.
2) Directions - This takes in two inputs (tags), From and To and shows the shortest possible route between the two places in the Maps section.
